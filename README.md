PYAADA.AI: A 3-screen clickable prototype for the ADAPPT 4.0 Startup Weekend. This AI SOC platform solves the "Triad of Pain" (L1 work, false positives, triage bottlenecks) by automating response.


♟️ PYAADA.AI - ADAPPT 4.0 Startup Weekend
This repository contains the complete 3-screen clickable prototype for PYAADA.AI, created for the ADAPPT 4.0 Overnight Innovation Challenge.

PYAADA.AI is a conceptual AI-powered Security Operations Center (SOC) platform designed to solve the three core problems crippling modern security teams:

Too Much L1 Work

False Positive Fatigue

The Triage Bottleneck

🚀 The Demo
This prototype (built in HTML/CSS) simulates the "before and after" experience of using our AI.

screen1.html: The "Problem" – A legacy, cluttered SOC dashboard flooded with 1,200+ alerts.

screen2.html: The "Solution" – PYAADA.AI's "AI Analyst" filters the noise into 3 clean, prioritized incidents.

screen3.html: The "Power" – The "Context Engine" provides a generative AI summary, an auto-built kill chain, behavioral anomaly data, and an automated response playbook.

💡 Core Features Demonstrated
AI Analyst: Correlates smaller alerts into major incidents.

Smart Filter: Uses behavioral analysis to detect zero-day exploits.

Context Engine: Reconstructs the full kill chain, manages centralized logs, and automates threat response.
